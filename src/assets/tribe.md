## Tribe

A place to come to fulfil desires
To meet the kind folk and be inspired.

Those that like to rest and stare,
Them that come to give and share,
Some to feel the earth laid bare,
others just want to show they care.

And when they gather within the carr,
Blessed they are by sun, moon, and star.
The monthly meet aligns an ancient rhythm,
A universal heart, nature beats within them.

The woodpecker knocked to the splitting of wood,
The songbirds smile sang for they knew it was good.
The trees looked down as they too understood,
Then the night embraced them as it should.
